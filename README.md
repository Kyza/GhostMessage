# GhostMessage

GhostMessage allows you to send a message which deletes itself as soon as you send it. Why is this useful? This allows you to notify someone of something without cluttering up the chat, or to send a message which deletes itself after 10 seconds.

## Usage

Click the new button in the text area to toggle sending ghost messages.
